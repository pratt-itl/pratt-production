<u>Introduction</u>
Automatization and efficiency with unparalleled precision are the cornerstones of the Zund Digital Cutting system. Its multi axis, conveyor belt hold down system, with seven different tooling options with a range of various blades and bits allow for a variety of different materials spanning from soft to hard, in a range of various sizes - most notably large format!
At first glance the Zund Digital Cutter can be thought of as being located in the middle ground between a laser cutter and a CNC mill, but it's this middle zone and the material offerings, stock sizes and precision that renders this a unique and powerful tooling option.
