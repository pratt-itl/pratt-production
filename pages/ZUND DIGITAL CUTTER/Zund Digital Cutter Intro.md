<u>Introduction</u>
Automatization and efficiency with unparalleled precision are the cornerstones of the Zund Digital Cutting system. Its multi axis, conveyor belt hold down system, with seven different tooling options with a range of various blades and bits allow for a variety of different materials spanning from soft to hard, in a range of various sizes - most notably large format!

At first glance the Zund Digital Cutter can be thought of as being located in the middle ground between a laser cutter and a CNC mill, but it's this middle zone and the material offerings, stock sizes and precision that renders this a unique and powerful tooling option.



<u>Material</u>
The Zund can handle a range of materials but principally should be utilized as a tool for those materials that are not suitable for a laser cutter or a CNC mill. Broadly speaking this may cover materials with an aerated interior, materials that react or break down with heat, materials that exceed a laser bed or those that would be too difficult to clamp down to a CNC mill. 

The benefits of the Zund Blade system is that the tooling operation does not introduce heat or burn to the material resulting in no off gassing, burn mark, loss of precision or other unintended negatives that heat introduction to materials produces. 

The larger list of *only some* of the suitable materials for use on the Zund are as follows:

- Fabrics
- Films
- Meshes
- Open Cell Foams
- Felt
- Vinyl
- Thick Stock Papers
- Closed Cell Foams
- Cardboard
- Foam Board
- Corrugated Plastic Boards
- Honeycomb Sandwich
- Plastics
- Styrene
- Rubbers
- Acrylic
- Expanded PVC Board
- Plywood
- Metal Composites
- Soft Metals

The ITL, a part of the normative offering for production on the Zund, is providing, as a start, stock materials offered at below competitive rates - corrugated cardboard, honeycomb sandwich board, 2ply bristol, 4ply bristol and a varying thickness of black and white foam board.
